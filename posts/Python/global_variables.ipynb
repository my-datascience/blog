Scoping rules can be difficult and requires a deep understanding of the Python language, something I don't claim to have. So, this post is, as always, a mix of how I understand the topic and what I was able to find and verify online (no ChatGPT-only answers). The focus here was to cover the most important and veryfiable scenarios and behaviors of the language."

Most of the class scoping behavior is determined by these two facts. Let's look at some examples."

It completely skips the body of the class, because it is not the enclosing scope.
