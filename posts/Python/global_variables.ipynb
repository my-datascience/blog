The focus here was to cover the most important and veryfiable scenarios and behaviors of the language."

As a result, class bodies are NOT enclosing scopes for class functions (or instance methods). Also, scopes of class bodies disappear after the class is defined. Names defined in a class body are moved to the attribute dictionary of the class (`__dict__`) after the class is finished defining, but the scope itself disappears. As a result, the scope enclosing class functions (and thus instance methods) is the scope in which the class is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second important thing is that code in class bodies, unlike code in functions bodies, is evaluated immediately at the class definition time. I mean, code inside a function isn't run until the function is called. But code inside a class body is evaluated immediately as the class is being defined.\n",
